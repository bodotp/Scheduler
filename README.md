Small auto-scheduling program I made while learning sqlite and tkinter modules. 
Schedule.db currently only contains information for Friday on Week table, so main program only works for Friday.
Drop down with window file is stable file and has notes pertaining to what I still want to do with the program.
Window2 scratch has extraneous lines of code as line comments just to show what I was trying to get to work.
